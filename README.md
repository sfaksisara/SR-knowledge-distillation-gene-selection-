# Symbolic Regression-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Interpretable Gene Selection in Cancer Classification

This repository contains the implementation of our novel approach combining symbolic regression with knowledge distillation for interpretable gene selection in cancer classification tasks.

## Abstract

Our method leverages genetic programming to discover meaningful gene interactions while using knowledge distillation to transfer complex patterns from teacher models to interpretable student models, achieving high classification performance with enhanced biological interpretability.
